i am a first-year ph.d. student in the [department of computer science](https://cs.jhu.edu) at [johns hopkins university](https://www.jhu.edu), advised by [joshua vogelstein, ph.d.](https://jovo.me) and [jessica sorrell, ph.d.](https://jlsorrell.github.io/). i collaborate under the [neurodata lab](https://neurodata.io) and the [learning theory group](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdinitz/theory/), where i work at the intersection of theoretical machine learning, statistical methodology for high-dimensional data, reinforcement learning, and optimization. i am also a member of the [mathematical institute for data science](https://www.minds.jhu.edu/) and the [institute for data intensive engineering and science](https://www.idies.jhu.edu/).

my research is supported by the [johns hopkins computer science department fellowship](https://www.cs.jhu.edu) and the [gem phd employer fellowship](https://www.gemfellowship.org/gem-fellowship-program/) through the [idaho national laboratory](https://inl.gov) and [whiting school of engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/)

previously, i earned a b.s. in [applied mathematics and statistics](https://ams.jhu.edu) from johns hopkins university as a [cummings scholar](https://apply.jhu.edu/tuition-aid/types-of-financial-aid/need-based-scholarships/cummings-scholars-program/). following my undergraduate education, i earned an m.s.e. in [data science](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/academics/graduate-studies/ms-in-data-science/) from johns hopkins university as a gem employer master's fellow and rubenstein fellow.
